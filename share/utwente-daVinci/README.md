This directory contains the configuration files for the Da Vinci set-up at the University of Twente.

The .cal files from `jhu-daVinci` were used a basis for the new configuration. The tracking numbers on our parts were not yet present in the lists.

The XMLs generated from the .cal files were overwritten by the calibrated ones.
